# Visual dictionary for learning Japanese

This repo is part of many new prototype features for learning languages in new, lighter and easier ways.

In the visual dictionary, you can first look at a category of pictures, like animals or emotions, with the corresponding target language word below it. Only upon mouseover (or touch on mobile device) do you see the word translated to English. The idea is to both help learning with the visual cue, as well as not over-rely on translations, but to move towards thinking directly in the target language. There's also a quiz feature, that you can use for practicing more actively.

It's currently built with npm create-react-app, but a refactor to Vite would make sense in the near future.
